It was a normal Wednesday morning. Nothing unusual.
 Until Mr. Majd came in, The whole class could smell trouble, And knew what was about to happen.
Afwan was the kid who got the blame, playing games on his tablet happily, but he didn’t know that he was the one about to start the “Great Game Purge”. 
Mr. Majd said “DELETE ALL THE GAMES, NOW!” he screamed. Every kid was shocked. All Thoe games were already banned, they still got ways to go around the rules, but this. This was something else.

Everyone took their tablets out panicking, shaking, horrified. 
Mr. Majd deleted terabytes of games, data, and anything else he could find, BURNING DATA AND DETENTIONS ON ANYTHING AND I MEAN ANYTHING HE COULD FIND.
 But one kid didn’t THINK of deleting anything, the kid who hacked the Computer Lab, the same kid who broke the SDP, THE EXACT SAME kid who could take down a government.
Shuja,
 He found a way to hide all the games and make it impossible for ANY teacher to find the terabytes worth of apps, games, and whatever else they could find. (remember this)
Moving on. It has been 3 hours since the first incursion. Its math class, Mr. Majd walked in again in a dramatic way, and once again said “DELETE EVERTHING.”
The Whole Class froze. Not computing what just happened.
You see, in our school, Video Games were already banned, but the teachers didn’t mind if we had them, the only thing they worried about is using them in class, But this time, this time was something else, Mr. Majd was erasing anything and everything.
Photos, games , apps, and important documents being shredded.
After he deleted everything, he stood at the door saying in a scary, deep voice
 “Anything I find, I will find them and remove them once and for all, and don’t even think of downloading them again.”
As he walked out. The whole class was shocked and little did they know, the Second of Hundreds more was about to come.
